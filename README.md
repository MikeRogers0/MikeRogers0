My name is Mike, welcome to my GitHub Page!

🕴 I’m currently working on [Typo CI](https://github.com/marketplace/typo-ci), a spellchecker for Pull Requests.

🙏 I’m looking for help with [Ruby Starter Kits](https://github.com/Ruby-Starter-Kits/), a way for people to get Ruby up and running with just docker.

📫 How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MikeRogers0) & [My Site](https://mikerogers.io/)
